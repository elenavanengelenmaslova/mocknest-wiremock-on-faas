# Spring Cloud Function

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Java 21** or later installed
- Git for version control
- Gradle (the project uses the Gradle wrapper, so you don't need to install it separately)
- IDE of your choice (IntelliJ IDEA recommended for Kotlin development)

### Cloud Provider Requirements
This project can be deployed to either AWS or Azure or both. Depending on your target environment, you'll need:

#### AWS Account Requirements
- An AWS account with permissions to:
  - Create and manage Lambda functions
  - Create and manage API Gateway resources
  - Create and manage IAM roles and policies
  - Create and manage S3 buckets
  - Deploy AWS resources via Terraform

#### Azure Account Requirements
- An Azure account with permissions to:
  - Create and manage Azure Functions
  - Create and manage Storage accounts
  - Create and manage Application Insights
  - Assign roles to managed identities
  - Deploy Azure resources via Terraform

## Build Project
After checking out the project, ensure it can build properly by running:
```bash
./gradlew build
```
from the root of the project.

## Update Infrastructure
If you plan to deploy the infrastructure, you may need to update the following:

### AWS
- Update the AWS region in the workflow file if needed (default is "eu-west-1")
- The S3 bucket for Terraform state is set to "kotlin-lambda-terraform-state" (this bucket must exist before deployment)
- The S3 bucket for Lambda deployment is set to "lambda-deployment-clean-architecture-example"

### Azure
- Update the Azure resource group name (default is "DefaultResourceGroup-WEU")
- Update the Azure region if needed (default is "West Europe")
- The storage account for MockNest is set to "demomocknest" (this storage account must exist before deployment)
- The storage container for Terraform state is set to "vintikterraformstorage" (this container must exist in the storage account before deployment)

Ensure to run `generateTerraform.sh` after any infra changes in the appropriate cdk module (aws or azure) to regenerate terraform configuration.

## Configure Pipeline

> ⚠️ **Security Notice**  
> This demo project does **not** use OpenID Connect for simplicity. For an example project that uses OpenID Connect, see https://github.com/elenavanengelenmaslova/kotlin-clean-architecture-example-docs-flow.
> If you are deploying to company environments, always follow your organization's security policies and configure GitHub Actions with proper role-based access control. 

If you are using GitHub Actions for deployment, you'll need to configure the following repository secrets:

### AWS Deployment Secrets
- `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`: Your AWS account ID
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY`: Your AWS access key
- `AWS_SECRET_KEY`: Your AWS secret key

### Azure Deployment Secrets
- `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`: Your Azure subscription ID
- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`: Your Azure client ID
- `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`: Your Azure client secret
- `AZURE_TENANT_ID`: Your Azure tenant ID
- `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME`: Your Azure storage account name
- `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_ACCESS_KEY`: Your Azure storage account access key

## Testing: Postman Collections and Environment
The `docs/postman` directory contains Postman collections and an environment file for testing the MockNest API:

### Collections
- **AWS MockNest Conf Demo.postman_collection.json**: Collection for testing the MockNest API deployed on AWS
- **Azure MockNest Conf Demo.postman_collection.json**: Collection for testing the MockNest API deployed on Azure
- **Health Checks.postman_collection.json**: Collection for running both AWS and Azure health checks

AWS and Azure collections contain requests for:
- Creating mock API endpoints
- Testing mock endpoints
- Resetting mappings
- Viewing near misses (requests that almost matched a mapping)
- Checking the health of the service
- Deleting mappings

Health Check collection is a shortcut to run all health checks at once.

### Environment
- **Demo Example.postman_environment.json**: Contains environment variables used by both collections

#### Environment Configuration
Before using the collections, you need to configure the environment variables:

**For AWS deployment:**
- `AWS_URL`: Set to your AWS API Gateway endpoint
- `api_key`: Set to your AWS API Gateway API key

**For Azure deployment:**
- `AZURE_URL`: Set to your Azure Function App endpoint
- `admin_function_key`: Set to your Azure Function admin key (for admin operations)
- `client_function_key`: Set to your Azure Function mocknest key (for client operations)
